### Identificators not resolving

Some identificators are created as a CodeSystem since they only have OID-s in Estonia. But for a better readability we created TIS FHIR identificator CodeSystem. These system uris don't resolve. In future this problem will be tackled.

### CodeSystem property -issues

Error "Wrong type 'string': The URI 'http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties#synonym' identifies a property that has the type 'code'" is a known issue of Estonian Terminology server. 

This issue will be solved on Terminology server side in near future.
